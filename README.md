# üöÄ **SmartPath AI: Deep Learning-Powered Route Optimization System**

## üìö **Project Overview**

**SmartPath AI** is a web application that leverages machine learning and high-performance route computation algorithms to provide efficient and diverse route suggestions for road networks. Inspired by cutting-edge research, this project offers an advanced navigation system that computes alternative routes in real-time, adapts to road network changes, and supports dynamic user preferences.

### üîó **Research Paper Inspirations**

This project is inspired by two research papers:

1. **[Deep Learning-Based Alternative Route Computation](https://research.google/pubs/deep-learning-based-alternative-route-computation/)**

   - Focuses on using deep learning to predict high-quality alternative routes efficiently.
   - Implements the **Customizable Route Planning (CRP)** architecture to improve route computation speed.

2. **[Efficient Location Sampling Algorithms for Road Networks](https://research.google/pubs/extracting-small-subgraphs-in-road-networks/)**
   - Focuses on optimizing location sampling to reduce data transmission while maintaining prediction quality.
   - Enhances the efficiency of route computation by reducing the volume of sampled data.

## üîÑ **Workflow**

1. **User Request**:

   - The frontend (Next.js) sends a request for route computation via the API Gateway.

2. **Route Computation (Golang)**:

   - The Go service extracts relevant subgraphs and computes potential routes using efficient algorithms.

3. **ML Predictions (Python)**:

   - The Python service predicts the best via-nodes and alternative routes using trained deep learning models.

4. **Combining Results**:

   - The Go service incorporates ML predictions and finalizes the route options.

5. **Response**:
   - The API Gateway sends the computed routes back to the frontend for display.
